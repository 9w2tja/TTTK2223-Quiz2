1. Please install JFLAP.
2. By using JFLAP, for \alpha = {a,b}, construct DFA’s that accept the sets consisting of 
a)	All strings with at least one a and exactly two b's. Test your DFA for the strings abb, bba, bab, bbbb, bababa.
b)	All strings with no more than three a’s. Test your DFA for the strings b, a, abba, bbaabab, ababbaba.
